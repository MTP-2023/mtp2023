      "The project commenced with a kick-off meeting on February 13th, followed by an internal meeting on February 15th. During these sessions, the team got acquainted with the project's subject, established objectives, and crafted a work schedule. Noteworthy achievements include setting up computers, defining the project's structure, selecting tools, conducting initial tests, and creating a reinforcement learning guide. The team is now gearing up to welcome Romanian students, with plans for their onboarding and a first online meeting to integrate them into the team.",

      "We arrived in Cluj, Romania on 15 March and had a lovely evening getting to know the Romanian students at a local restaurant. The week started with an invigorating 24-hour hackathon where we tackled a related problem, developed environment and frontend prototypes and finished the week with a short presentation. After the hackathon, we made sure all team members were aligned and started project work. Besides our tasks, we explored the vibrant scene of Cluj, enjoyed the bars and the local cuisine. At the weekend we visited an old salt mine, which is now an amusement park with a lake.At the end of the week, we presented our progress and outlined our future plans. We finished with a cosy dinner where all the teams came together in a local restaurant. This week in Cluj fostered collaboration, learning and cultural immersion.",

      "We worked seamlessly together on all designated tasks and milestones, effectively aligning our efforts. We immersed ourselves in the subject of curriculum learning and strategically arranged the challenges to optimise the learning process. We moved to action and began agent training on the bwunicluster platform and utilised its capabilities. In parallel, we integrated weights and biases into our workflow and enabled online tracking and storage of training runs. This valuable tool allowed us to better monitor our progress. Our commitment to improvement led us to refine our agents and critically evaluate the underlying logic to ensure their effectiveness and relevance.",

      "Throughout May, we encountered a two-fold challenge that prompted us to engage in theoretical exploration to enhance our learner and refine outcomes. Our focus extended to the refinement of challenge generation and a deeper dive into the intricacies of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).Expanding our training horizons, we not only fine-tuned Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) but also introduced the alternative AlphaZero approach. The fusion of our agents' gameplay with the frontend interface provided a dynamic visual representation of their challenge-solving journey. In preparation for the midterm presentation, we meticulously summarized and presented the strides we had taken in the project. As this chapter closed, our collaboration with the Romanian students concluded. We marked this transition by recapping the valuable lessons and insights gained during our shared journey",

      "At the midway point, we held our crucial interim presentation. It became clear that a crucial shift in the development of our project was needed. Due to the computational limitations in reinforcement learning, an important decision was made: We switched to developing an online game based on the original game rules. This change brought with it a new set of tasks and goals. Central to this transition was the selection of a design theme, with our main focus on adapting the main game mode to thrive as a 1v1 multiplayer experience. By making quick decisions, we were able to locate a suitable framework and seamlessly integrate a compact game prototype into the front-end. This marked a significant turning point that would redefine the direction and creative scope of our project.",

      "On 15 July, we warmly welcomed Romanian students to Germany, kicking off an eventful week. In the midst of our joint efforts, we focused on the final stages of the project, which are a testament to our shared commitment: \n Finalising the revised design of the front-end, \n fine-tuning the game physics and implementing various game mode, \n setting up server functionality to support online play, \nInvestigating the impact of game mode changes on agent performance.\n In parallel, the Romanian students explored the city and enriched their experience. At the end of the week, we met with the startup Osapiens and presented our project results in a presentation that summarised our hard work and innovation.In the following week, we completed the remaining tasks, improved the game visualisation and consolidated the backend. In addition, we started preparing for our final presentation, which would crown the successes, growth and relentless commitment of our journey.",
